<h2 id="conclusion"> Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Their is lots of data about imigration per country and these numbers are published in many places and are major talking points in every country. The raw number of imigrantes only tells a very small story about what is happening within a country as a whole. 
    Only knowing the imigration number for a country dosn't allow for much informed insight without other data sournding it. This could be imigration number in relation to other similar countries, the demographic's of the immigrants their level of education and many other factors
    that all paint a bigger more full picture of what is happening. The number of immigrants is the most thought about number as the people within the country fear it is the number what will have the biggest impact on their lives. From these four visualisations we hope 
    it has become apparent that one number alone is not sufficient and is relatively meaningless. It is our hope that our visualisations have answered questions you may of had and given you an appreciation for how complicated migration is and how our world is more interconnected
    then ever before and everyone can take advantage of that in some way, whether it be emigrating to a different place to help your own situation or on a macro level industries being able to produce more strengthening the countries economy.
