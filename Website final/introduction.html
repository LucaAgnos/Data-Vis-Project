        <p> The projectâ€™s broad topic was global migration, two thirds of all international migration is hosted by 20 countries around the world. Of the 20 main destinations for migrants seven were in Europe, Germany being the second largest host for migrants as of 2019 <br> 
            hosting about 13 million. Europe has had high rates of migrants over the past 20 years and for this project, we wanted to focus on Europe specifically looking at why Europe is in this position.
            <br>
            <br>
            The purpose of these visualisations is to answer questions about migration our audience may have about Europe and Germany. We developed four questions which we used as a guide into what our visualisations should be and what data we will need 
            to find to answer them.
            The first question we wanted to answer is, which countries within Europe accept large amounts of immigration? The second question is of those that immigrate to Germany what demographic do they belong to, is their significant age and gender 
            differences in who immigrates? Third question is how does emigration and migration affect the population of Germany?  Fourth question is immigration uncontrolled in countries with high immigration?
