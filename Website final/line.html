                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    From the Visualisation we can see the that the amount of imigrants entering the country is higher then those that are leaving. Though since 2015 we can see that emmigration
                    is increasing and the gap between the two are closing. Their was a dip in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic though the small dip has already rebounded the next year and 
                    shows it will continue to increase. 
                    <br>
                    The German Federal Institute for Population Research conducted a survey with 10 thousand respondants as part of a longtidudinal study between 2014 to 2023 released findings in 2019.
                    From the survey it found that 76% of emigratns have a univeristy degree, and are majority between the ages of 20 to 40 with the average age being between 36 and 37.
                    From this survey the number one reason for emigration was for their career with the second being a desire for a change in lifestyle. From this group 60% said their household income 
                    was more then the year previously and for women or lower educated people the increase was even more significant. On average people living abroad were earning on average 
                    12,000 euro more. As the cost of living continue to increase in Germany mainly lead by the price of houseing its possible those that have the oppertunity may seek to move to another
                    where their education may allow them to have a higher paying job with less difficulty when in a different country.
