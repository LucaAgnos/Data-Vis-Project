                    Imigration is a very hot button topic for most nations and the major talking point is the potential loss of jobs driving up unemploymeant for local people. As was seen in the previouse visualisation the rate of people emigrating to other
                    countries is also increasing. The reason for emigration is numerous though if large amounts of people are leaving countries as people come in is their much weight to the concerns of people that the large amounts of imigration is a problem.
                    The net migration rate is the difference between the number of people immigrating and the poeple that are emigrating from the country during the course of a year. It is calculated by dividing net migration by total population of a country times by 1000.
                    A positive net migration rate corelates with more people immigrating then are emigrating while a negative will represent the opposite. This rate gives us an insight into how imigration is effecting the population of a country and if too many imigrants 
                    is leading to a balloning population that could lead to valid critisims of employmeant being too high and no job options for people born and raised in the country in question. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the Visualisation below we look at the net migration rate for three countries, United States of America, Germany and the United Kingdom, from 2000 to 2022 with real data points and then a projection is used uptil 2030. 
                    The US was chosen as it is the only country with higher rates of migration then Germany. While the UK is often times 
                    accepting the most imigration behind Germany in Europe though this is begining to change as Spain is becoming a more popular destination for imigration. From the Visualisation below we can tell that each of these countries net migration chagne over the years
                    is very distinct United Kingdom has a very steady curve. The reason for this steady curve is strict control of their policies involving imigration and trying to keep a steady control of who is coming in. A secondary charcteristic that countries use is the percentage 
                    of forign-born population over a long period of time. The UK has stayed at a similar level the past decade hovering between 12-14% of their total population. A direct policy which shows why they were able to keep this so steady is in 2015 the Prime Minister of Britan 
                    anouced they would accept up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years. When compaired to Germany in 2015 accepted about a million reffugees in 2015 alone. The policies that control UK's system are likely favoruing skilled workers and students as they still have large amounts of imigration
                    though not large amounts of allowing asylym seekers. With a steady rate this also means that many people must be leaving United Kingdom as well and this is likely why skilled labour is able to move into the UK and get work as the previouse skilled labour could be moving 
                    countries similar as what we found is happening in Germany in the previous page.

                    Another interesting piece of data is the difeernece between the three countries between 2021 and 2022. With the ending of most COVID-19 lockdowns and countries oppening back up for travel while the US saw a major jump in its net migration the other two countries saw a further dip.
                    From this set alone we can't make any conclusions though it does allow a few questions to be asked and allows for a easy place to begin further investigation. One posibility is people are not imigrating to other countries as further restrictions are inplace that 
                    make it harder to gain access to these countries? Though as is demonstrated through previous visualisation though a dip in 2020 by 2021 imigration was already increasing to close to pre COVID-19 numbers. A seccond posibility is people are moving away from countries
                    that had strict COVID-19 lockdowns to countries that had loser ones. This is a possible reason for an increase in emigration what was seen in the previous visualisation. Or it is possible after people being in lockdown they had saved funds to perhaps try something brand new.
                    Some respones in the German Federal Institute for Population Research indicated wanted to change due to COVID-19.

                    These countries have some of the highest amounts of immigration in the world and yet they keep a relatively similar net migration rate showing that even though lots of people are immigrating many people are leaving the country and each of these countries
                    have in recent times published they have a nessecity for workers in industries, the UK has had a shortage of nursers since 2015, Germany has began making steps to try entice more workers as of 2022 1.74 million jobs are vacant while in the US some institues
                    state that 3.5 million workers are missing. Immigration and Migration play a critical balencing act for each country so they can meet demmand of their own economy and still give residents the ability to move between jobs.
