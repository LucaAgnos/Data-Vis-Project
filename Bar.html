        <p> 
        <p> 
            The projectâ€™s broad topic was global migration, two thirds of all international migration is hosted by 20 countries around the world. Of the 20 main destinations for migrants seven were in Europe, Germany being the second largest host for migrants as of 2019 hosting about 13 million. Europe has had high rates of migrants over the past 20 years and for this project, we wanted to focus on Europe specifically looking at why Europe is in this position.
            <br>
            The audience that will be aimed at for this project will be students in both school and tertiary studies to give them easy access to a visualisation for their own report. This is important as our visualisation will allow for complex ideas and questions to be answered in a simple way for those that are beginning to look into a topic to understand. This is why aiming our audience at students is ok as our visualisation will allow for complex ideas to be expressed quickly and accurately.

        <h4>What is Cost of Living and Local Purchasing Power?</h4>
        <p>To understand why Singapore has gotten it rating, first we should try to understand what this means. As a stated before the Cost of Living Index measures the price change of goods and services 
           and The Local Purchasing Power shows relative purchasing power in buying goods and services. As started on Investopedia "Purchasing power loss or gain refers to the decrease or increase in how much consumers can buy. Consumers lose purchasing power when prices increase. They gain purchasing power when prices decrease.". 
           </p><p>
           It might of been a bit hard to see the exact values but the site states that the CoL Index was 84.0 and the Local Purchasing Power was 91.3.
           So what does it mean?. Singapore's Cost of Living means that the cost for purchasing essentials is quite high. This could lead to multiple reasons such as food, rent and purchasing power.
           When digging deeper into the cost of living we can see that food partially is responsible since within the index it includes a Groceries Index which sits at 77.08 which is higher than average. 
           This is due to Singapore having 90% of food imported, since Singapore has limited space to work with, the best outcome was to have food imported so that they aren't giving up land. Another factor was rent,
           since the area of space Singapore has to work with is quite small, finding a place to stay can be quite difficult let alone keeping it. This would explain why their Rent Index is at 66.43, encouraging the idea that living in the city is expensive.
        </p><p>
           So how does the Local Purchasing Power come in, well it establishes that most people living Singapore can cover their costs and have more spending opportunities. So while food and rent may be higher than other countries, their wages allow them to cover it. 
           Another small index within the Local Purchasing Power is the Consumer Price Index which measures the change in the price basket of goods and services consumed by households. These can be the expenses that the day to day activities a Singapore citizen does. 
           Singapore's CPI was 112 in February which is quite high. A high CPI usually leads to higher inflation rates which could lead to the Local Purchasing Power to decrease, leading to less spending chances.
        <br>
            This overall leads to Singapore to be sitting in the middle of the Cost of Living Index which quite good, since the limited amount of space prevents them from doing much, it is impressive to see how most citizens are able to find a place to stay and eat while those prices continue to increase.
            We will now look more into how much it costs to live in one of these area's in Singapore from the graph below.
