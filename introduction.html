        <p> The projectâ€™s broad topic was global migration, two thirds of all international migration is hosted by 20 countries around the world. Of the 20 main destinations for migrants seven were in Europe, Germany being the second largest host for migrants as of 2019 hosting about 13 million. Europe has had high rates of migrants over the past 20 years and for this project, we wanted to focus on Europe specifically looking at why Europe is in this position.

            The audience that will be aimed at for this project will be students in both school and tertiary studies to give them easy access to a visualisation for their own report. This is important as our visualisation will allow for complex ideas and questions to be answered in a simple way for those that are beginning to look into a topic to understand. This is why aiming our audience at students is ok as our visualisation will allow for complex ideas to be expressed quickly and accurately.
