        <p> How our introduction will go, what is below is an example from my cost of living</p> 
        <p> The cost of living is the amount of money that is needed to cover the basic essentials for survival. These can be things such as housing, healthcare, food and taxes. 
            I have decided to do some research into Singapore to see how they have been struggling with the cost of living due to certain events making it harder to cover the essentials.
            My goals are trying to find out what is Singapore's cost of living and what are the reasons for it to be that.
            To showcase how and why the cost of living has impacted them, I will be using data visualisation to express the data in a visual way rather than reading numbers that don't mean anything while they're by themselves.
            To start off, I will be presenting a dot chart, highlighting were Singapore is located compared to the rest of the world with it's Cost of Living index and the local purchasing power. 
            Next is a bar graph to empathise why Singapore's cost of living is high by presenting the monthly cost for a a single person with/without rent, a couple and a family of 4 and finding out why those are the prices.
            Lastly, I have a pie chart that covers the average cost of living in Singapore and finding out what expenses have higher priority than others and seeing if it connects with reasons for why the cost of living is high.
            This data visualisation is meant for all audiences to help understand why Singapore's cost of living is high by having a graph and explaining what the graph means.
